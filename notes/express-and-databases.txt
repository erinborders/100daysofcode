EXPRESS AND DATABASES OVERVIEW

- the best way to interact with a database = 1. using the db's native query language (e.g. SQL), or 2. using an Object Data Model (ODM) or Object Relational Model (ORM); they represent the website's data as JS objects which are then mapped to the underlying db
- best performance = using the db's query language (ODM/ORM are often slower because they use translation code to map between objects and the db format)
- benefit of ORM's = provide an obvious place to perform data validation (unless performance is paramount, strongly consider using one)
- mongoose = a mongodb object modeling tool; acts as a frontend to mongodb 
- waterline = an ORM extracted from the Sails web framework (similar to express but aimed at more data driven api's)
- bookshelf = provides transaction support
- sequelize
- graphQL

DESIGNING MODELS

- have separate models for every 'object' (group of related info) that you want to be able to change dynamically
- UML models = show the models we'll define as boxes and the relationships between them , including their multiplicities (the max and min of each model that may be present in the relationship)
- better to have the field that defines the relationship between documents/models in just one model
