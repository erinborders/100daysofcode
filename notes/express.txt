EXPRESS LESSON

You will want to create your own modules, because this allows you to 
organise your code into managable parts — a monolithic single-file 
application is hard to understand and maintain. Using modules also 
helps you manage your namespace, because only the variables you explicitly 
export are imported when you use a module.

To make objects available outside of a module, you just need to expose
them as additional properties on the exports object.

Example:

In square.js file

exports.area = function(width) { return width * width; };
exports.perimeter = function(width) { return 4 * width; };

Then you can import like so

var square = require('./square'); 
(Here we require() the name of the file without the (optional) .js file extension)
console.log('The area of a square with a width of 4 is ' + square.area(4));

If you want to export a complete object instead of building it one property
at a time, assign it to module.exports

module.exports = {
	area: function(width) {
	    return width * width;
	},

	perimeter: function(width) {
	    return 4 * width;
	}
}

You can think of exports as a shortcut to module.exports (it's just a variable that
gets initialized to the value of module.exports before the module is evaluated)

Using callbacks can get messy, but this can be avoided by using a module like
async or moving to ES6 features like promises

MODULE BEST PRACTICES

- move repeatedly used code into a function
- when your function or group of functions gets big enough, move them into their
own file and expose them using module.exports
- if you have code that can be used across multiple projects, give it its own readme, tests,
and package.json and publish it to github and npm
- individual files in a module shouldn't be longer than about 150 lines of JS

CREATING STANDALONE NODE MODULES
- create a package.json file (npm init for unscoped modules, npm init --scope=@scope-name for scoped modules; provide the name, version (start with 1.0.0), main (the name of the file that will be loaded when your module is required...the default is index.js))
- create the file that will be loaded when your module's required by another app
In this file, add functions as properties of the exports object
- test your module by publishing it to npm (for private packages - use npm publish, for public packages - us npm publish --access public), installing it to a test directory and then requiring it in a test file

ASYNC OVERVIEW

- an npm module that helps you work with async JS
- includes methods like reduce, filter, etc, but also has common patterns for asynchronous control flow (async.parallel, async.series, async.waterfall, etc)

PROMISE OVERVIEW

- represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value

Example:

function successCallback(result) {
  console.log("Audio file ready at URL: " + result);
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.error("Error generating audio file: " + error);
}

createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings, successCallback, failureCallback);

Can be written as:

createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings).then(successCallback, failureCallback);

Which can also be written as:

const promise = createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings);
promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);

- you can chain thens, catches, and thens after those catches (which will be the actions that run whether or not there's an error)

NODE BEST PRACTICES

- the 'error first' callback is the standard for node js callbacks
- continuation passing style (cps) is the old-school name for node's heavy use of callbacks (where continuation functions are callbacks)
- node relies on async code to stay fast so having a dependable callback pattern is crucial
- throwing errors shurts down your entire application


ERROR HANDLING EXAMPLES:

if(err) {
  // Handle "Not Found" by responding with a custom error page
  if(err.fileNotFound) {
    return this.sendErrorMessage('File Does not Exist');
  }
  // Ignore "No Permission" errors, this controller knows that we don't care
  // Propagate all other errors (Express will catch them)
  if(!err.noPermission) {
    return next(err);
  }
}

MORE ABOUT CALLBACKS

- callbacks can be called in parallel, in a queue, in serial, etc (the async library is great for that)

// Example taken from caolan/async README
async.parallel({
    one: function(callback){
        setTimeout(function(){
            callback(null, 1);
        }, 200);
    },
    two: function(callback){
        setTimeout(function(){
            callback(null, 2);
        }, 100);
    }
},
function(err, results) {
    // results is equal to: {one: 1, two: 2}
});

MORE ABOUT EXPRESS

- express HTTP verb methods include: checkout(), copy(), head(), notify(), etc
- app.all() will be called in response to any HTTP method; used for loading middleware function at a particular path for all request methods

Example:

app.all('/secret', function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...');
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});

- it's useful to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using a common route-prefix; this is achieved via express.Router

Example:

// wiki.js - Wiki route module

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

// Home page route
router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Wiki home page');
});

// About page route
router.get('/about', function(req, res) {
  res.send('About this wiki');
});

module.exports = router;

While in the main app file (app.js) we would require the route model (wiki.js) and call use() on the express app to add the router to the middleware handling path

Example:

var express = require('express')
var app = express()
var wiki = require('./wiki.js')

app.use('/wiki', wiki);

USING MIDDLEWARE

- middleware functions are functions that have access to the req and res objects as well as the next middleware function in the app's req/res cycle (commonly denoted by a variable named next)
- middleware functions typically perform some operation on requests/responses and then call the next function in the 'stack' which might be more middleware or a route handler (as opposed to route functions, which end the HTTP request-response cycle by returning some response to the client)
- if middleware doesn't end the req/res cycle then it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function or the req will be left hanging
- common middleware tasks: working with cookies, sessions, user auth, logging, etc

EXAMPLE WITH MORGAN REQUEST LOGGER MIDDLEWARE

- install it with npm then write the following

var express = require('express');
var logger = require('morgan');
var app = express();
app.use(logger('dev'));

- middleware and routing functions are called in the order they're declared; middleware is usually called before setting routes, otherwise your route handlers wouldn't have access to functionality added by your middleware
- app.use() applies the middleware to all responses
- app.METHOD() applies the middleware to responses with a particular HTTP verb

EXAMPLE:

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// An example middleware function
var a_middleware_function = function(req, res, next) {
  // ... perform some operations
  next(); // Call next() so Express will call the next middleware function in the chain.
}

// Function added with use() for all routes and verbs
// will be executed every time the app receives a req
app.use(a_middleware_function);

// Function added with use() for a specific route
app.use('/someroute', a_middleware_function);

// A middleware function added for a specific HTTP verb and route
app.get('/', a_middleware_function);

app.listen(3000);

EXAMPLE OF LOADING A SERIES OF MIDDLEWARE FUNCTIONS AT A MOUNT POINT WITH A MOUNT PATH

app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})

- To skip the rest of the middleware functions from a router middleware stack, call next('route') to pass control to the next route. NOTE: next('route') will work only in middleware functions that were loaded by using the app.METHOD() or router.METHOD() functions.

EXAMPLE:

app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
  if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')
  // otherwise pass the control to the next middleware function in this stack
  else next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  // send a regular response
  res.send('regular')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which sends a special response
app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('special')
})

EXPRESS EXAMPLE WITH ARRAYS

function logOriginalUrl (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}

function logMethod (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
}

var logStuff = [logOriginalUrl, logMethod]
app.get('/user/:id', logStuff, function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('User Info')
})


ROUTER LEVEL MIDDLEWARE

- works in the same way as app level middleware (router.use and router.METHOD)
- define your router middleware, then mount it on the app 

app.use('<path>', <router name>)

- To skip the rest of the router’s middleware functions, call next('router') to pass control back out of the router instance.

EXAMPLE:

// predicate the router with a check and bail out when needed
router.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (!req.headers['x-auth']) return next('router')
  next()
})

// use the router and 401 anything falling through
app.use('/admin', router, function (req, res) {
  res.sendStatus(401)
})

ERROR HANDLING MIDDLEWARE

- Define error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature (err, req, res, next)), otherwise the code will think it's regular middleware and fail to handle errors

TO USE THIRD PARTY MIDDLEWARE

- require it then load it

var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')
app.use(cookieParser())

CONFIGURABLE MIDDLEWARE

- if you need your middleware to be configurable, export a function which accepts an options object

EXAMPLE
In my-middleware.js

module.exports = function (options) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    // Implement the middleware function based on the options object
    next()
  }
}

Then you can use it like this:

var mw = require('./my-middleware.js')

app.use(mw({ option1: '1', option2: '2' }))
